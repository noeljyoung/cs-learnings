# System Design Problems and Solutions

1. Ready-heavy system
	- Use caching for faster reads
2. High-write traffic
	- Use async writes
	- Use LSM-Trees Database
3. Single point of failure
	- Implement redundancy and failoverSingle point of failure
4. High Availability
	- Use load balancing
	- Use replication
5. High Latency
	- Use CDN to reduce latency
6. Handling large files
	- Use block storage and object storage
7. Monitoring and Alerting
	- Use centralized logging solution
8. Slow database queries
	- Use proper indexes
	- Use sharding to horizontally scale
