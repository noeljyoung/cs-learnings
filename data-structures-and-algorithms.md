## Runtime Complexity

| Worst Cast | Name             | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1          | Constant Time    | Always takes the same amount of time.                        |
| log(n)     | Logarithmic Time | Doubling the amount of elements does not double the amount of work. Think of it as the inverse of n^2 where we are halving the amount if elements on each iteration. Searching operations. |
| n          | Linear Time      | Proportional relationship between the elements and runtime   |
| n * log(n) | Quasilinear Time | Sorting operations                                           |
| n^2        | Quadratic Time   | Every element has to be compared to every other element. The 'handshake problem'. |
| 2^n        | Exponential Time | The work doubles each time the input is increased by 1.      |
